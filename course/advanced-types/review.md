# ADVANCED OBJECT TYPES
# Review
ðŸ™Œ Way to go! You have advanced through this entire lesson. No one will object to your superior TypeScript knowledge. Hereâ€™s an overview of what we learned:

We can use both interface and type keywords to declare types.
interface is great for typing objects, especially within object-oriented programs.
We can apply an interface on a class using the implements keyword.
Object types can be nested infinitely.
We can define multiple types and compose them together to organize our code and make it more flexible.
We can copy the type members of one interface into another using the extends keyword.
We can define variable property names within an object type with an index signature. An index signature uses syntax like: [propertyName: string]: string.
Itâ€™s possible to make some type members optional, using the ? operator. The syntax looks like name?: string.
Use the code editor to polish your understanding of typing objects in TypeScript.
